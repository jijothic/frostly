# frostly
Created with CodeSandbox
# React suspense/concurrent example

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v8 or greater
- [yarn][yarn] v1 or greater (or [npm][npm] v6 or greater)

## Setup
To do so, please follow these instructions.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed (as
indicated above), you should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/jijothic/frostly.git
cd frostly
npm run setup --silent
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser.

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) in watch mode. Read the
output and play around with it.
